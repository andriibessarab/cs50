                    Originally called Magic Cube. Each of six faces of rubik's 
                    Cube are covered by nine stickers that have the same colour. 
                    There are six sides. Each side has one of the following colours: 
                    white, yellow, green, red, blue, orange. Puzzle is solved, when each 
                    face has been returned to have only one colour.</p>
