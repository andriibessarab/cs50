# PyPI World
PyPI World is a web application made to simplify the process of uploading programs to [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org).PyPI(Python Package Index) is a website where all the distributions for the Python package-management system(pip) are stored. However, when you are thinking of publishing your own package there, this process is not that simple by itself. Many files(that are just mandatory, and don't really make any difference) must be created, a few terminal commands must be run, and more. For those reasons, PyPI World was created. Now, all you have to do is link your GitHub repository and PyPI Account to your project on PyPI World; provide some mandatory information(like name and version), and your project is good to go. This process will take you a few minutes instead of a few hours(looking through giant documentations searching for you need to do to build a valid distribution). Now, you can focus on your program, while PyPI World will focus on distributing.
